      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am making a website for my friend and I to play Coup
        Do you know what Coup is? It's a bluffing game, you're trying to outwit the other.
        Right now I am working on the Home page. The idea is that it should contain links to rules and a place to play.
        The idea is to be able to play with him whenever we want to play, since they took the app down.

        Welcome to Coup! In the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new "royal class" of multinational CEOs.

        Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.
        
        Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of
        
        The Resistance have created discord, intrigue, and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse. But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.
        
        To be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.
        
        In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.

        (Taken from the instructions and the game itself)

        As the newest member of the Resistance one may chose to either participate in our training program or simply show us initialtive and dive right in!
